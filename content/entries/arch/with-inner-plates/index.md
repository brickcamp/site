Fitting plates onto the underside of arches is not a new technique, but the 1x5x4 arch presents an interesting geometry. When the plates are placed snugly together, they form 15° angles. This is an angle that is otherwise difficult to achieve with LEGO bricks, especially if it must be repeated in the same plane.

An interesting use of the new D-SNOT bricks that I haven't done anything with yet. I envision these making a nice rounded edge on a wing or fin or whatever in pretty much any shape, This configuration requires the arch bricks with thick sides in order to work, so options are limited, but in real life I'd probably use bar-clips on flex tube.
