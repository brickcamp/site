Fitting plates onto the underside of arches is not a new technique, but the 1x5x4 arch presents an interesting geometry. When the plates are placed snugly together, they form 15° angles. This is an angle that is otherwise difficult to achieve with LEGO bricks, especially if it must be repeated in the same plane.
