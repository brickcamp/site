Since the Reddish Brown color of my minifig scale Minecraft block makes the individual parts hard to see when following the instructions, here’s the instructions for the original Light Bluish Gray design.

Frequently, LEGO designers sacrifice true scale in official sets for the sake of playability. A prime example of this is in the Minecraft theme, where the “block” is far too small to represent an in-game block when compared to a minifigure. @the_legobuilder fixes this problem, creating a perfect 3×3 cube that is significantly more true to scale.
