The Lowell Sphere is a SNOT (Studs Not On Top) LEGO sphere design that consists of six identical curved panels built onto a cubic frame. The original sphere uses a 4x4x4 stud core with an outside diameter of 6.8 studs.

This is nothing new to most builders. A young Lego enthusiast came and saw my collection and was baffled by how I was able to make a sphere. I made him instructions keeping in mind his small collection and lack of Travis bricks. I just thought I'd upload it anyway.
