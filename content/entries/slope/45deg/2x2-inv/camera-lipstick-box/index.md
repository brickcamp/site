Maybe you've noticed that Wednesdays have been silent lately. For good reason! The competition is hot and heavy over at the Reverse Engineering Challenge IV (REC4). I've been fighting and scratching to stay in the lead with about 34 other contenders, and that's just first place. Needless to say, my brain capacity for showing off new techniques has been limited. Want to see some incredible stuff that pushes the limits of the brick? Head over to the Flickr Group and see what's happening.
