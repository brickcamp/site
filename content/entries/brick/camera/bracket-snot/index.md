Just noticed this when putting parts away. I am sure I am not the first to discover it. This forms a very tight connection. The studs on top and anti studs are aligned diagonally. The studs on the side line up perfectly for proper attachment of another element. Come join me on Facebook Youtube Instagram Rebrickable Keep Dreaming in Bricks!
